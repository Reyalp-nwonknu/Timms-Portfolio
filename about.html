		<h1> About. </h1>
		<p> Hi, my name is Timm. Thanks for visiting my little portfolio website.

			I’m a mechanical engineer who has specialised on user centered product design and human-machine-interaction. Recently I’ve broadened my skillset by completing a course in User Experience Design. Some of the results you can review on this website. I was always convinced that creating new products is only useful when they make people’s lives a bit better. Now, as a UX designer, I learned how to understand the goals and needs of potential users even better and integrate them in a step-by-step approach to create new products.

			Apart from creating products for humans, I enjoy listening, playing and dancing to music, being outdoors and keeping myself fit with workout and (tower)running.

			If you want to learn more about me, feel free to <a href="contact.html"> contact </a> me anytime!
